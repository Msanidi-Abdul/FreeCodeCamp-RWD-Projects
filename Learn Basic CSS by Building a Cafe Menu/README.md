This is a simple website showcasing a cafe menu. It consists of an HTML file (`index.html`) and a CSS file (`styles.css`).

## HTML File (`index.html`)

## CSS File (`styles.css`)

The CSS file contains styles for the cafe menu website. It includes styles for various elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, and the footer. The styles ensure a visually appealing and user-friendly presentation of the menu.
